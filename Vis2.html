<td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">These three bar charts show the average height, weight and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">body mass index</a> of female athletes in different olympic sports. Each bar chart is sorted from maximum to minimum for each attribute. Weighlifting is highlighted in darker colours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> In the height bar chart things are as we might expect - basketball, volleyball and beach volleyball are the three sports with the tallest athletes. Weightlifting appears to have the shortest athletes on average, something I did not anticipate. The weight bar chart largely recapitulates the height bar chart - sports with taller athletes all have heavier athletes (including basketball, rowing, volleyball). Weightlifting, which I anticipated to have the heaviest athletes, ranks quite far down the list. However, the BMI chart shows a slightly clearer story. Weightlifters have the highest average BMI, suggesting a stockier build. Judo is also highly ranking, as might be expected. Consistent with having a very slight build, triathletes have the lowest BMI </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> I have used bar charts as they are very effective at conveying quantitative information. By sorting the sports based on the values of each attributes the usability of these charts is greatly increased, e.g. it is immediately evident which sport has the highest and lowest average BMI. Using a different luminance for the weightlifting bar makes it pop out and makes it easy to compare its ranking in accross all three attributes.<p/> The 'small multiples' approach invites comparison between the different sports although there is an increase in effort required of the reader due to the varying ordering between charts.  Sorting all charts based on a single attribute (e.g. height) would make it easier to see how the different data attributes vary together but make it harder to identify the sports with the minimum and maximum weight or BMI. A <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/parallel-coordinates/">parallel coordinates</a> plot would potentially be the best of both worlds, but would only be useful to readers familiar with this visualisation type. Male athletes could be shown on a second set of small multiples but the major trends remain the same and it increases the size and complexity of the visualisation. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Data filtering and transformation:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Only female athletes with recorded heights and weights greater than zero are shown. I have removed athletes that competed in multiple sports (typically multiple cycling events) as indicated by the presence of a comma in their 'Sport' field. I have created a new field (BMI) by combining the weights and heights according to the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">standard formula</a>. </td>
